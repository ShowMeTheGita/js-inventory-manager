Original project that led to this one [here](https://github.com/ShowMeTheGita/spring-boot-inventory-manager).  
A simple inventory manager. Two inputs can be made and are sent to a table, which in term stores them and presents them dynamically. Data can also be manually deleted afterwards.
Currently working out the bugs that are not present in the original project, mostly around editting and duplicates.

### Why?

This version of the "Inventory Manager" was created as a way to be able to mirror the original project, but be more user-friendly because it can be hosted and quickly accessed via Github Pages. It was also a way for me to brush up on some basic JavaScript and DOM traversing.
